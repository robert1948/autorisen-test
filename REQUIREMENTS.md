   - Provide authentication mechanisms to secure user access.

2. Device Integration and Monitoring
   - Enable users to connect and integrate various IoT devices.
   - Gather device data and provide real-time monitoring capabilities.
   - Display device status, health metrics, and alerts.

3. User Management
   - Implement user roles (e.g., administrator, standard user) with appropriate access levels.
   - Allow administrators to manage user accounts and permissions.

4. Device Management
   - Provide a dashboard for users to view and manage their connected devices.
   - Enable users to add, remove, or update devices.
   - Support device grouping or categorization for easier management.

5. Real-time Analytics and Reporting
   - Generate insights from device data using real-time analytics.
   - Display key metrics and visualizations to help users make informed decisions.
   - Provide reporting features for exporting or sharing analytics results.

6. Issue Tracking and Support
   - Allow users to report issues or incidents related to devices or the platform.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Security
   - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Ensure data encryption during transmission and storage.
   - Apply best practices for protecting sensitive user and device information.

2. Scalability and Performance
   - Design the platform to handle a growing number of connected devices and users.
   - Optimize performance to provide a responsive and smooth user experience.

3. Compatibility
   - Support integration with a wide range of IoT devices and protocols.
   - Ensure compatibility with major web browsers and operating systems.

4. User Experience
   - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.
   - Ensure responsive design for a consistent experience across different devices.

## Timeline and Milestones

1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis - 2 weeks
2. Design and Prototyping - 3 weeks
3. Front-end and Back-end Development - 8 weeks
4. Testing and Bug Fixes - 2 weeks
5. MVP Deployment and User Acceptance Testing - 1 week

Note: The timeline and milestones provided above are approximate and should be adjusted based on the project team's capacity, availability, and other project-specific factors.

## Conclusion

These requirements provide a baseline for developing the "Autorisen" platform up to the MVP deployment. Further discussions and collaboration with the development team will be necessary to refine and prioritize these requirements as the project progresses.
